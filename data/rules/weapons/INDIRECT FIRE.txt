INDIRECT FIRE
Can target and make attacks against units that
are not visible to the attacking unit.

If no models are visible in a target unit when
it is selected, then when making an attack
against that target with an Indirect Fire
weapon, subtract 1 from that attackâ€™s Hit roll
and the target has the Benefit of Cover against
that attack.
