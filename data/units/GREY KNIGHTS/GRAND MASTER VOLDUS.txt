GRAND MASTER VOLDUS
Grand Master of the 3rd Brotherhood, Aldrik Voldus wields immense
psychic might with a humble purity. Daemons burn and scatter before
the purifying fire that pours from his huge daemon hammer, the
Malleus Argyrum, before he deftly swings it and crushes those that
remain with a thunderous crash of pure empyric energies.
