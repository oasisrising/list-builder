GREY KNIGHTS LAND RAIDER REDEEMER
The Land Raider Redeemer is armed with flamestorm cannons that
it uses to burn the stain of the daemonic clean. This brutal assault
vehicle dominates urban warfare, spraying promethium from its
flamestorm cannons and bursts of shot from assault cannons,
before unleashing its payload of Grey Knights to purge the survivors.
