STRIKE SQUAD
Strike Squads often form a vanguard, striking swiftly and slipping
through gaps in daemonic lines to seal warp portals or prevent
summoners escaping. Frequently attacking from fixed teleportariums
or rapid transports, they conduct vital reconnaissance, disrupt flanks
and blunt incursions with surgical strikes.
