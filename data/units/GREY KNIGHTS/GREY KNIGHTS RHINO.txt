GREY KNIGHTS RHINO
The Rhino is an ancient design of transport that has supported Space
Marines for millennia. Its rugged and reliable systems are vital for
surviving the mutating landscapes of daemon worlds the Grey Knights
sometimes fight across, while the warriors inside are shielded by thick
armour and a warded truesilver mesh.
