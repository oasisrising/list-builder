BROTHERHOOD TERMINATOR SQUAD
Brotherhood Terminators form the steel heart of many Grey Knights
strikes. Shielded by thick armour plates, each is a warrior of immense
physical and mental fortitude. They often teleport directly into battle,
unleashing sanctified bolts before cleaving apart the spawn of the warp
with blazing Nemesis force weapons.
