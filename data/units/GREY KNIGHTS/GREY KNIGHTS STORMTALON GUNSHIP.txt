GREY KNIGHTS STORMTALON GUNSHIP
Stormtalon Gunships are highly manoeuvrable aircraft as versatile
in role as in their choice of target. Often running escort duties for
larger craft, they hunt down warp-spawned foes. Using vectored
afterburners, their pilots unleash ground attacks, saturating
teleportation zones with fire and clearing them for their brothers.
