GREY KNIGHTS VENERABLE DREADNOUGHT
Venerable Dreadnoughts house truly ancient champions whose
revered belligerence endures war after war. Their strategic acumen
and wisdom of ancient horrors banished in past battles is respectfully
sought, but they still take to the battlefield with a stoic resolve, and to
fight alongside these living legends is a high honour.
