INTERCEPTOR SQUAD
Bearing personal teleporters, Interceptors jump across the battlefield
in a series of rapid, site-to-site teleportations, redeploying at speed
or hunting down swift foes. Arriving in a blaze of light, they turn their
weapons and powers on stunned enemies in a storm of death, before
vanishing as swiftly as they arrived.
