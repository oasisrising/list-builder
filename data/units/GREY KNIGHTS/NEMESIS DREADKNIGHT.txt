NEMESIS DREADKNIGHT
The pilot of a Nemesis Dreadknight commands a towering exoskeleton
armoured in thrice-blessed bonded ceramite. Powered by his psychic
might, its heavy weapons scythe through warp-spawned hordes, while
with giant fists or enlarged force weapons it smashes daemon-infused
vehicles and titanic horrors to ruin.
