GREY KNIGHTS STORMHAWK INTERCEPTOR
Squadrons of Stormhawk Interceptors – such as the Andaemus
Flight – operate at lightning-fast speeds even through warptortured
skies. Designed to achieve aerial supremacy at high altitudes,
the psychic pilots of these aircraft duel not with blades but with
batteries of missiles and rapid-firing cannons.
