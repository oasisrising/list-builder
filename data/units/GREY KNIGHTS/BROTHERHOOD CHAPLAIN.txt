BROTHERHOOD CHAPLAIN
Chaplains intone psychic litanies of sanctity and contempt, speaking
the Emperor’s word to their brethren in stentorian tones. They are
symbols of brutal mortality and unquestioning zeal. In battle, they
lay about the foe with blows from their crozius arcanum and with
impassioned canticles ward their brothers’ souls.
