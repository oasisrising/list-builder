SERVITOR RETINUE
At the start of the Declare Battle Formations step, this unit
can join one other unit from your army that is being led by a
Brotherhood Techmarine (a unit cannot have more than
one Servitors unit joined to it). If it does, until the end of the
battle, every model in this unit counts as being part of that
Bodyguard unit, and that Bodyguard unit’s Starting Strength is
increased accordingly.
SERVITORS
Some servitors were once serfs, failed aspirants or former allies, now
cyborgised with mechanical augmentation. Many have limbs replaced
with servo-arms or heavy weapons, employed to defend or aid their
Techmarine masters during repairs. The brutal mind-wiping process
ensures none ever reveal what they have witnessed.
