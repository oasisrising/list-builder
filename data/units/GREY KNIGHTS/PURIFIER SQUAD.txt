PURIFIER SQUAD
The Order of Purifiers epitomise the Grey Knights’ sanctity of purpose.
They are incorruptible and fanatical, possessed of an untarnished
spirit. Teleported into the heart of daemonic legions, they often fight
as a spearhead from where they unleash a cleansing fire that sears
the corrupted to ash.
