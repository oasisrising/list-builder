CASTELLAN CROWE
Castellan Garran Crowe is the Champion of the Order of Purifiers, and
his flawless soul radiates outward in a searing, psychic aura. He is the
keeper of the Black Blade of Antwyr, a daemon sword that whispers
promises and threats. Crowe rejects the blade’s vileness, trusting to
his masterful combat prowess.
