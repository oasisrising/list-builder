TYRANID WARRIORS WITH RANGED BIO-WEAPONS
Strong, swift, independently intelligent and amongst the Hive Mind’s
most adaptable bioforms, Tyranid Warriors are the backbone of many
Tyranid invasions. Their synaptic link imbues them with advanced
martial abilities, and also allows them to serve as synaptic linchpins
within the wider swarms during battle.
