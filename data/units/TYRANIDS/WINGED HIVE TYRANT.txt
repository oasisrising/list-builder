WINGED HIVE TYRANT
When the Hive Mind deploys airborne swarms, it spawns Winged Hive
Tyrants to direct them in battle. Wielding an array of nightmarish
organic weapons, their monstrous forms singing with the synaptic
might of the Hive Mind, these dread swarm-leaders spread terror and
death wherever the dark shadow of their wings falls.
