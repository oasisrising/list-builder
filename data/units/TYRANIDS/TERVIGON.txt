TERVIGON
Beyond simply being large and powerful synapse beasts, Tervigons
are also able to spawn skittering masses of Termagant warrior
organisms from within their bulging abdomens. These dripping spawn
instinctively protect their broodmother with their lives, their numbers
growing all the time until they overwhelm the prey.
