HIVE GUARD
Hive Guard are spawned to protect Tyranid bio-architecture and
vital spore-seeding sites. They carry a monstrous arsenal of grafted
bio-weapons and are instinctively driven – or sometimes synaptically
impelled – to lay down heavy hails of firepower against those prey
organisms the Hive Mind wishes to see eradicated.
