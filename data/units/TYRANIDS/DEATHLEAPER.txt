DEATHLEAPER
The Deathleaper is an advancement of the Lictor strain intended to act
as a terror weapon. Possessing an instinctive understanding of how
to spread fear through prey populations, it uses its skills in stealth,
infiltration and assassination to sow paranoia and dread before the
hive fleet attacks en masse.
