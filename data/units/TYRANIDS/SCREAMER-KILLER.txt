SCREAMER-KILLER
An older adaptation of the basic Carnifex strain, the Screamer-Killer
was christened by terrified Imperial troops for the distinctive howl
it emits as it generates then unleashes its bio-plasmic blasts.
Screamer-Killers are often seen at the forefront of a Tyranid assault,
where they can inflict the most damage quickly.
