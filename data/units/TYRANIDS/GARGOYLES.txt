GARGOYLES
Gargoyles are often the first warrior organisms hurled against a prey
world. Their teeming swarms darken the skies. Their opportunistic
attacks spread panic and disarray. Worst of all, the creatures can
squirm through gaps that appear far too small, bursting through gun
slits and vent pipes to assail horrified defenders.
