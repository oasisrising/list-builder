RAVENERS
Serpentine bioforms capable of a terrifying turn of speed, Raveners
are made doubly dangerous by their ability to tunnel swiftly through
even solid bedrock. Often assaulting their prey from below, Raveners
are especially vicious and predatory warrior organisms used as shock
troops by the Hive Mind.
