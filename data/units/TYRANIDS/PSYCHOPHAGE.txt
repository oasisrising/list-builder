PSYCHOPHAGE
These monsters stampede into battle with frightening speed. They
devour any prey organism in their paths, but especially favour those
victims with psychic abilities. How they metabolise such esoteric
powers is unclear, but doing so allows them to project surges of
psychocorrosive ash that deflagrate their victims’ minds and souls.
