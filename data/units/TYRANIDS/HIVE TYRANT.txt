HIVE TYRANT
Hive Tyrants command the swarm on the Hive Mind’s behalf. Not
only are they powerful warrior organisms in their own right, but they
are also possessed of a depth of sentient autonomy and strategic
cunning that makes them truly deadly foes. Where the Hive Tyrants
bestride the battlefield, death comes for the prey.
