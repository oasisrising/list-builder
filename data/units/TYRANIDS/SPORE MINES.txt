SPORE MINES
Spore Mines are a form of living mine or bomb, which drift across the
battlefield in shoals and detonate when they detect prey organisms
nearby. Those caught in the blast are torn apart as surely as if they
had caught a brace of live frag grenades. The Hive Mind often uses
Spore Mines to deny areas of the battlefield to the prey.
