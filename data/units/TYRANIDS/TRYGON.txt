TRYGON
Trygons are battle-tank-sized living tunnelling machines. As they dig
through the substrata of the prey world, they excavate huge tunnels
for other Tyranid beasts to exploit. At the same time, the rasping of
their chitinous plates builds up a powerful bio-electric charge that the
Trygons can unleash as a weapon.
