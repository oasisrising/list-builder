PYROVORES
Pyrovores exist to predigest biomass. The acids that drip from their
maws are so corrosive they can melt adamantine. Meanwhile, their
flame-spewing dorsal organisms can engulf entire squads of prey in
roiling chemical fire. Even killing these bioforms is perilous, for their
volatile innards can detonate upon death.
