THE SWARMLORD
The Swarmlord is the herald of the Hive Mind and may be as old as
the Tyranid race itself. Upon death, the beast is always absorbed
through the synaptic link and spawned anew. It has presided over the
annihilation of countless civilisations, and with every incarnation it
only becomes more deadly.
