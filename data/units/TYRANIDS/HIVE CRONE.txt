HIVE CRONE
Hive Crones scour the skies for prey fighter craft. The tentaclids they
release pursue enemy aircraft before erupting in bio-electric pulses
that banish motive force and send the dark, dead machines tumbling
groundward. Then, drool cannons slathering, the Hive Crones dive
down to seek fresh, land-based prey.
