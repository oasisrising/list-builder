VON RYAN’S LEAPERS
Stealthy hunters and expert ambushers, Von Ryan’s Leapers are swift,
agile and especially lethal when fighting in dense terrain. Akin to
living mines, they lie still at the optimum locations to cause as much
damage as possible. When they sense the perfect time to strike, they
butcher all around in a murderous frenzy.
