MALECEPTOR
Amongst the most powerful Tyranid psyker-analogues yet known,
Maleceptors wield colossal synaptic power. Ethereal psychic
pseudopods lash about them, able to literally detonate victims’ skulls
with the slightest touch, while the encephalitic orbs set into their
carapaces focus the smothering dread of the Shadow in the Warp.
