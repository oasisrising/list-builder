BIOVORES
These living artillery pieces nurture a clutch of Spore Mines within their
bodies. After anchoring themselves to the ground with their chitinous
spurs, the creatures fire their living ammunition in high arcs, allowing
the Spore Mines to drift languidly down into the midst of the foe where
they detonate with sudden violence.
