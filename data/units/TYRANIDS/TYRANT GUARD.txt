TYRANT GUARD
Incredibly well armoured and resilient, Tyrant Guard form a mobile
bulwark around their assigned synapse organism. So extreme is their
bio-adaptation, they do not even possess weak spots such as eyes.
Instead, they are guided as extensions of their charge’s synaptic will,
acting as living weapons and shields.
