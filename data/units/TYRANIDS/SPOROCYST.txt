SPOROCYST
Dropped from orbit, Sporocysts dig into the surface of the prey world
like ticks then begin spewing toxic spores from their living chimneys.
They are able to eject shoals of Mucolid Spores, while prey who
stray too close are subjected to hails of organic projectiles from the
bio-cannons grafted to the Sporocyst’s hide.
