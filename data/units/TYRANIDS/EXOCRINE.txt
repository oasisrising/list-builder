EXOCRINE
Huge, tough and very stupid, the Exocrine’s only task is to carry the
dorsal cannon organism on its back into an optimal firing position.
Once in place, the bio-plasmic cannon emits a terrible, high-pitched
hiss before unleashing a searing blast of bio-plasma capable of
reducing tanks and bunkers to glowing craters.
