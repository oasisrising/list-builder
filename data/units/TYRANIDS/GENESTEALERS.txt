GENESTEALERS
Swift vanguard organisms armoured in chitin and possessed of
terrifying strength and agility, Genestealers are peerless predators.
Their broods move ahead of the hive fleets to seek out fresh feeding
grounds. Then, when the invasion swarms descend, the Genestealers
burst from hiding to begin the slaughter.
