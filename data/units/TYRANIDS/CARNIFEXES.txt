ABILITIES
CORE: Deadly Demise 1
FACTION: Synapse
Blistering Assault: Each time an enemy unit is selected to
shoot, after that unit has shot, if any models from this unit lost
one or more wounds as a result of those attacks, this unit can
make a Blistering Assault move. To do so, roll one D6, adding 2
to the result: each model in this unit can be moved a distance
in inches up to the result, but this unit must finish that move
as close as possible to the closest enemy unit. When doing
so, those models can be moved within Engagement Range
of that enemy unit. Each unit can only make one Blistering
Assault move per phase.

CARNIFEXES
Carnifexes have been a mainstay of the hive fleets for centuries.
Rugged and adaptable organisms, they can support a great range
of weapon grafts and biomorphs while retaining the raw strength,
durability and armoured ferocity that has seen them smash through
countless prey defence lines like living battering rams.
