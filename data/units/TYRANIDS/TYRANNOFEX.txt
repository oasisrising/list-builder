TYRANNOFEX
The Tyrannofex is a walking battle tank and heavy weapons platform
of huge size and resilience. These warrior organisms are extremely
well armoured, more than capable of going toe-to-toe with the heaviest
battle tanks of their prey species in a shooting match. Few foes can
stand against even one of these beasts.
