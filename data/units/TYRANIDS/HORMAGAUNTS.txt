HORMAGAUNTS
Swarming shock troops, Hormagaunts are seeded onto prey worlds in
their billions. As simple hunter-slayer organisms, they can be left to
rampage, wearing down defence lines and forcing the prey to expend
lives and ammunition. Many formidable bastions have been buried in
literal mountains of these chitinous horrors.
