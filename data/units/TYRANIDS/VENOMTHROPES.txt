VENOMTHROPES
Venomthropes drift forward amidst miasmal clouds of spores that
spew from within their bodies. The touch of their tendrils is extremely
poisonous, and those exposed to the Venomthropes’ spore clouds for
any length of time drown on their own frothing fluids as they dissolve
from the inside out.
